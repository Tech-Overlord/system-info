# system-info
# INTRODUCTION:
Cross-platform scripts developed in Python3 for fetching and providing runtime CPU, RAM, PIDs, OS and system information.

### Audience:
Quite simply, everyone. From a student to a system engineer, from a software developer to an IT enthusiast. It's developed with the thought to be easily used by anyone :wink: .

## Pre-requisites:
1. **Python3**
    * Python 3 is easily available for free to download, install and use on windows & *nix platforms. If you do not have Python 3 installed on your machine where you require the use or execution of these scripts, please feel free to use the following methods:
        * **Windows**: [Python3.7.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) is the latest major Python release that can easily be downloaded and installed. _Note:_ Python 3.7.0 was the major release at the point of this development. Feel free to use a newer 3.x Python version if you desire.
        * **Ubuntu LTS OS's**:  Pre-installed on Ubuntu LTS OS's i.e. 16.04 xenial & 18.04 bionic.
2. **`psutil`** library
    * **Windows**: You can easily install psutil library using command prompt i.e. cmd. Just open cmd, and type in `pip install psutil` .
    * **Ubuntu LTS OS's**: Just run the [install_pre-reqs.sh]() script and it will take care of that for you.
    * **FYI** - [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) library was developed by [Giampaolo Rodola](https://github.com/giampaolo). It is a cross platform library for system level information. Kudos to Giampaolo !!!

## Tested on:
1. Windows Operating Systems (i.e. 7, 8, 8.x & 10). Works on Windows Server editions too.
2. Ubuntu 16.04 & Ubuntu 18.04
